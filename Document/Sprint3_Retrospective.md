# Sprint 3 - Retrospective

### What went well and what not? 

* __Not well__: 
    * Limited availability as team members have to focus on preparing for final exams and projects along with  other personal issues. 

    * Unable to deploy with Firebase due to some issues when hosting backend API. We were able to deploy with Vercel, however, there is a limit of 32 builds every hour. So we do need to look into other alternatives or return to Firebase in future development.

    * We had several merge conflicts as well as module's dependencies conflicts. Using ```npm install --legacy-peer-deps--``` resolved the issues. In the future, we agree that it would be most convenient for everyone to reclone the repository after every Sprint.

    * For some reason, the CSS component does not render properly on different browser (Firefox vs. Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge). This issue has been resolve by convert CSS to HTML on some components of the application. For the future, we should consider implmenting Bootstrap for uniformity across platforms.

* __Well__: 
    * We were able to complete all of our planned features and refined it during Sprint 3. We were also able to complete each task in a timely manner and stay on track.

### What might be impending us from performing better? 

* Should have recloned the repository after Sprint 2 Demo. This way, there would be less merge conflicts as Michelle has to rename and organize some files to be in the correct subfolders.

* Limited familiarity with Bootstrap for interface features. The interfaceâ€™s components (HTML and CSS ) would have been much easier, more organized and less time-consuming if I knew about Bootstrap sooner.
