# Sprint 1 - Retrospective

### What went well and what not? 
* __Not well__: 
    * We initially planned the project to be a mobile app, however, we encountered issues when it came to setting up the environment and necessary tools (React Native, Android Studio, SDK and Platform, etc.). 
    * We were also unable to execute the starter code properly (following this tutorial).
    * Most team members are unfamiliar with React and MongoDB as well as each of us prefer different languages (Python vs. Javascript)
    * We had several merge conflicts which we were unable to resolve properly, our solution was to merge our parts on one branch manually and then merge into the development branch.
    * Due to our inexperience in React and related technologies, it took us more time to complete tasks (and have to divide out in subtasks, hence the abundance of branches). However, we were able to complete each task in a timely manner.
* __Well__: 
    * We ultimately decided to change the project to be a web-based app instead as we have already wasted 3 days (Sunday to Tuesday) trying to figure out how to get the starter code to work. Fortunately we were able to configure everything quickly and smoothly so that we can catch up with the expected work pace.
    * While some of our research went unused (somewhat), we were able to get ourselves familiar with React and related technologies.

* __Isaiah__ : We were able to establish a foundation design structure for the project and successfully tackled everyone’s assigned task in a timely manner. I also worked on retrieving data from a website that gives updates on upcoming special events in San Marcos.
* __Benu__ : We were able to create a Client/Server application that connects with our database in MongoDB as well as setting up a basic database for venues in San Marcos.
* __Michelle__ : We were able to create a general interface that includes all of our planned features as being easy to navigate around for team member’s convenience during implementation and testing.
* __Nilu__ : We were able to retrieve key information of venues and special events in San Marcos using web scraping and display information from the database to the hosting site.
* __Jayce__ : We were able to implement geolocation-related functions using Leaflet, which reads the physical address of a venue and converts its coordination and display on map.

### What might be impending us from performing better? 
* Limited knowledge in React, MongoDB and related technologies, however, we were able to conduct basic research before working on Sprint 1 and plan to do the same for future sprint.
* Limited and conflicting time availability due to everyone’s class and work schedule. However, we were able to meet up during team time and in Zoom 2 times a week.
* Limited familiarity with GitKraken/Jira/Bitbucket which causes some of us to forget to commit often or create individual branches for each task.

### What can I do to improve?
* __Isaiah__ : To improve I will apply more time management in planning my portion of the project. As well as everything else, I need to also communicate more with others to see what others are working on so we can all be on the same page.
* __Benu__ : For me I know I need to improve my time management. I need to plan accordingly and find time to do research when I don’t understand stuff.
* __Michelle__ : I have some prior experience working with SQL databases so moving to a non-relational approach was a bit difficult at first. I will conduct further research and practice within the project in order to familiarize myself with NoSQL database architecture.
* __Nilu__ : Everything went pretty smoothly, however, at the beginning it was challenging for me to come up with the layout of the Special event page. After doing some research, I got a good idea of what the layout looks like. I think I need to improve on how to ask questions with team members instead of being stuck at something I do not know about. 
* __Jayce Turambe__ : To improve I will apply more time management in planning my tasks of the project and stick to the the schedule.
