## Research React-Native

**Title**: Research React-Native

**Why**: Due to our team's limited experience with React-Native, this research is very important to the development of the project. Researching into React-Native beforehand would allow us to improve efficiency and make the app development process faster and easier.

**Expectations**:

* Grasp React-Native basics for creating the app's interface.

* Incorporate key features like listing, searching, location sharing and user login.

**Actions**:

* Design user interface components with React-Native (include key information: hours, location, image gallery, etc.) 

* Implement a search feature to show clubs based on userâ€™s preferences

* Integrate a map with location features.

* Establish a user login system.

**Jira Tasks**: Given our team's initial unfamiliarity with React-Native, this research is very essential to the entire project, not just limited to a single Jira task. It lays the groundwork for the development of VibeTrack efficiently and without unnecessary challenges
