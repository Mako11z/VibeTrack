# Sprint 1 - Retrospective

### What went well and what not? 

* __Not well__: 
    * Limited availability as team members have to focus on preparing for midterms and other personal issues. 
    * Still need to figure out how to deploy our application to Firebase/Heroku/etc.

    * We had several merge conflicts which we were unable to resolve properly before the standup and had to decline the pull requests. However, we were able to find a way to solve it properly.

* __Well__: 
    * We were able to implement our intended features into the application, we still need to further refine these features in Sprint 3. 

    * However, we were able to complete each task in a timely manner and stay on track.

    * We were more prepared and knew what was needed after the first sprint


* __Isaiah__ : We were able to implement a feature where a user is able to send an email to an emergency contact containing the clubs the user will be visiting that night.

* __Benu__ : We were able to implement several functions that aim to enhance user experience, such as being able to rate a venue, getting recommendations of random venues, sending feedback, etc. However, due to unexpected life issues, I was unable to finish up the 3rd function.

* __Michelle__ : We were able to implement the login and signup features for the project with working codes. However, I still need to improve the authentication and security for users.

* __Nilu__ : We were able to further improve the Special Event features using live web-scraping to retrieve data on click. However, as I have to attend a conference over the weekend, I was unable to work on my features on this Sprint as much as I was hoping for.

* __Jayce__ : We were able to incorporate the search functionalities in our project. However, we still need to look into the simplegmaps library so that we can know how to use google API key to use google map functionalities.


### What might be impending us from performing better? 

* Should have documented the structure and functionality of the server side sooner than the start of Sprint 2 as half of the intended features revolved heavily around the database.

* Limited familiarity with Realm SDK for login and signup features. There are also very few online documentations and examples for referencing purposes.

* Limited familiarity with Bootstrap for interface features. The interface’s components (HTML and CSS ) would have been much easier, more organized and less time-consuming if I knew about Bootstrap sooner.


### What can I do to improve?

* __Isaiah__ : To improve I can on my documentation for my code so that my teammates can better understand my code.

* __Benu__ :  I can make sure I get my work done in a timely manner.

* __Michelle__ : I  need to think further ahead so that other teammates won’t have to wait for any documentation/references about my features in order to proceed with their tasks. 

* __Nilu__ : I think I can improve by being more active on discord so that I would not miss any chat about the project. I should be communicating with my group before I try to make any changes.  

* __Jayce Turambe__ : I need to work on refining task prioritization by implementing a better time management system, setting clearer deadlines, and regularly reassessing priorities for optimal productivity.
