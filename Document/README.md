## Future Vision <!-- Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development. -->
- Given that this is a course project, we have limited time to develop it to our full vision. Nevertheless, our goal is to develop a functional, user-friendly web app that offers information about nightclubs in the Austin area. If we choose to pursue this project beyond the classroom, we hope to broaden its reach, potentially extending the database across the country for a more expansive impact.
- Additionally, if we were to continue working on this project beyond the classroom, we will try to find additional resources like more time, expertise in specific areas, and potentially additional developers could help in expanding its scope statewide.
- User feedback and engagement would be crucial in fine-tuning and enhancing the app's features and functionalities. Therefore, we also would like to gather feedback from fellow Texas State students through beta testing. 

## Room for improvement: 
* For our current tier (Hobby), Vercel only allows **32 Deployments every 3600 seconds (1 hour)**, creating limitations on website accessibility. Moving forward, we will explore alternative hosting options for our project
	* Maybe return to Firebase but we will need to consider how the server API should be hosted.
* Our project currently **does not offer mobile support**, and we plan to address this in the future to cater to mobile users.
    * Additionally, there is an issue with **CSS rendering on different browsers** (Firefox vs. Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.) which was temporarily resolved. However, reimplementation with Bootstrap is in consideration for a more robust solution.
* **Refactoring** is a crucial task that requires prioritization. In the CS3398 course (Fall 2023), our primary goal was to deliver a functional product. However, for future development, our next objective will focus on optimization through code refactoring and thorough testing.
