## Research on Search component

**Title**: Research on Search Functionality Enhancement

**Why**: We are conducting this research to enhance the search functionality of our web-based app. This improvement is essential for helping customers discover nearby clubs that align with their preferences and interests, ultimately delivering a better user experience.

**Expectations**: 

* We expect to learn about modern search algorithms, techniques, and libraries that can improve the efficiency and accuracy of our search functionality.

* Specifically, we aim to identify methods for      implementing features such as location-based search, keyword-based search, and filtering.

* The research will impact the following modules of our app:
    * The Search component responsible for executing search queries.
    
    * The User Interface (UI) components that display search results to users.
    
    * Backend services and APIs responsible for handling search requests.

**Actions**:

* Research and analyze different search algorithms and techniques, such as text-based search, location-based search, and faceted search.

* Investigate the integration of search libraries for improved search performance.

* Evaluate potential options for location data and geospatial search, including libraries and APIs.

* Investigate techniques for implementing filters and refining search results based on user preferences.

* Collaborate with the development team to prioritize and plan the implementation of search enhancements.


**User Story**: [As a developer, I want to create a search and filter feature in the app that allows users to easily find nearby clubs with unique features or matching with their preferences.](https://cs3398f23romulans1.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1/backlog?epics=visible&selectedIssue=SCRUM-18)
