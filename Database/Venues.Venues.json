  "moreabout": "  From the time Kent Finlay and his business partner, Jim Cunningham, leased a creaky old warehouse along the railroad tracks in San Marcos, Texas, and opened Cheatham Street Warehouse in June 1974, the honky tonk seemed destined for fame in Texas music history. An Austin hippie country band, Freda (Marcia Ball) and the Firedogs played to an overflow crowd on an unbelievable opening night. As Kent’s brother, Steve, recalled, “At least five people behind the bar were selling beer as fast as we could open them. The beer box was soon depleted of cold beer and we kept icing down beer in an old bathtub behind the bar!”"

In May 2011, Zelicks was opened by brothers, Chase and Seth Katz, bringing a new, unique establishment to the San Marcos bar scene. Chase and Seth had lived, studied, and worked in San Marcos for some time and opened Zelicks as a place that would attract diverse clientele to its friendly atmosphere, making it the perfect place to make new friends or catch up with old ones. The site itself was originally a 1930s gas station and still shows the remains of being so. Zelicks is full of interesting and original design features, including the old framed photos of the life of Jack Zelick Katz who is Seth and Chase's grandfather and the bar's namesake. Zelick was instrumental in the brothers' success as he provided their first-ever loan when opening their first business, Dos Gatos Kolache Bakery. After the success of the bakery, Chase and Seth chose to name the bar Zelicks as a tribute to their grandfather's faith and support in their entrepreneurial endeavors. The photos that line the walls of the bar show Zelick's life and the many places it has taken him - from its start in Lithuania, to Cape Town, Johannesburg, and finally, Toronto."
